# cs3411-encode

Both encode and decode function as defined in the assignment as far as my testing has covered

Encode takes one argument as the file input and outputs the encoded file to stdout

Decode takes one argument as the file output and inputs an encoded file from stdin

./encode <file name> : Encodes the specified file and outputs it to stdout
./decode <file name> : Decodes stdin and places the decoded information in the specified file
